    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h2>Horse Sales And 
    Training in Powhatan</h2>
    <p>Levremont Farm L.L.C., in the heart of Powhatan, VA, opened in June of 2001. We specialize in the sale of field hunters and eventers and can find you the perfect horse and sell yours on. We offer horse riding lessons, from beginners on, whether you want to event, hunt or simply trail ride, with the emphasis on safety, horse-handling and management. While we are a 'hunt' barn during the  winter, we compete up and down the East Coast at the biggest Event competitions during the season. We offer boarding in large, airy  stalls with stall mats, and ample turnout. We also offer training, from bringing along a green horse to polishing a show horse and have experience with all kinds of temperaments - a horse at Levremont is a happy horse! Come ride with us!</p>
    <h2>Boarding and More</h2>
    <p> Levremont Farm offers a safe, professional environment at reasonable cost. The boarders' barn consists of large airy stalls with rubber mats, Dutch doors and fans. They are cleaned 1-2 times daily. We offer a specialized feeding program. We feed quality feeds, tailored to each horse, and quality timothy hay throughout the day to stalled horses. Supplements are added (owner to purchase) at no extra cost. Blankets/sheets are changed  according to weather. Our pastures are maintained throughout the year to ensure plentiful grazing. Horses are turned out individually or in pairs. All pastures have 3-board fencing and heated water tanks. Routine Vet and Farrier care is scheduled by our staff. On site stable manager and trainer provide a watchful eye 24 hours a day giving you the peace of mind that your beloved equine is well cared for. We offer boarders a discounted lesson/training package which includes 2 rides/lessons a week.</p>
    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p>Our goal as trainers is to help you learn to communicate with your horse properly, whether you want to show in the Hunters, Jumpers, Eventing, Equitation, or Pleasure Ride. We start all of our horses slowly and let them tell us when they are ready to move on to the next level. With the depth of our knowledge your horse will benefit from a perfect blend of American and European training. Our foundation in training is always correct flat work (straight, forward, rhythmic and balanced) then instilling basic Dressage in any horse, for any discipline. From starting a youngster, re-schooling the problem horse to fine tuning a show horse, our methods are traditional, tried and true. Lessons From the complete beginner to the advanced show rider, we have a program suited for you. The horses and ponies in our school program have been carefully selected for their temperament, training, and athletic ability. We pride ourselves in recognizing and bringing out the potential in every rider. To make a well rounded rider, we teach horsemanship, which means that you will learn to care for the horse, its tack and every aspect of its management. Our riders learn not only to ride in the ring but also on trails and over cross country courses. For those that do not own a horse but would like to show, we have seasoned Hunters, Jumpers and Equitation horses. Private and group lessons are offered to more experienced riders.</p>
